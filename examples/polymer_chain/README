This folder contains examples for a CopssPointParticle system, the point particle model is polymer Chain.
In this simple example, two beads are places in a confined box and doing Brownian motions.


1) "point_particle_control.in": defined simulation parameter that COPSS needs, including physical parameters, domain mesh info, force field, run info, etc. 
2) "point_particle_data.in": defined molecule configurations (in lammps data file format)

How to run this example:

1) Follow instructions to Compile PETSC, SLEPC, LIBMESH and then compile COPSS in /src.
2) Copy the executable "example-opt" into this folder
3) Copy "run.sh" from /tools into this folder
4) run "bash run.sh"

What you get:

1) A ".e" file which contains solutions, i.e., velocity, pressure, to the flow field at all time steps. 
2) ".vtk" files which contains configurations of the polymer Chain at different time step. 
3) "output_statistics.dat" which contains the statistics of your molecules, e.g., MSD, center of mass,etc. 


How to visualize the output:

1) You can load the ".e" and ".vtk" files into "Paraview" to visualize the motions of point particles within flow field. And I prepared a sample video of the results.
