#####Instructions to generate simulation data file
1. Install PACKMOL

	1.a. Go to folder ../packmol
	1.b. Compile PACKMOL by simply typing "Make"
	(if there are any errors reported, refer to http://www.ime.unicamp.br/~martinez/packmol/userguide.shtml)

2. Generate simulation data file (this example is only for spherical particles in a spherical cavity)

	2.a. Copy "packmol" excutable to whereever you want to generate your data file
	2.b. Build "cell.inp" and "spheres.xyz" (examples are given in /packmol_inputs/)
	2.c Generate output using packmol: "./packmol < cell.inp"

3. Alternatively, one can use bead_data_generator.py which only requires a "packmol" excutable to generate data.


###########details about the input file cell.inp################
#vi cell.inp
#
# generate N spherical molecules inside of a spherical cavity -- for cell project
#
# All the atoms from diferent molecules will be separated at least 2.0
tolerance 2.0
# The name of the output file
output spheres_in_cell.xyz
# The file type of input and output files is xyz
filetype xyz
# 100 spheres of radius=1.0 will be put in a spherical cavity defined by center (0,0,0) and radius=50.
# the structure of the spheres is defined in spheres.xyz
structure spheres.xyz
number 100
inside sphere 0. 0. 0. 50
radius 1.0
end structure

###########details about spheres.xyz################
#since the spheres in our case is just a single particle instead of a molecular containing multiple atoms,
#we don't need to specify the relative positions of all the atoms of a molecule
